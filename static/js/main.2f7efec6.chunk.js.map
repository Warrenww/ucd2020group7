因為系統的特色是可以利用區塊及階層的方式顯示物品的相對位置，所以他們需要在空白的虛擬空間中進行建構，這部份正是所有受測者覺得系統困難的點。 其原因如下：\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>figma 本身難以模擬「拉區塊」指令，原意是希望使用者可以自由調整區塊的大小</li>\r\n                <li>受測者在第一次使用的時候，無法理解階層的概念，原意是想變得像檔案總管跟資料夾那樣，但因為同時加入了不一樣的條件（系統需要設定至少三階層才可以存入物品資訊），造成使用者難以上手</li>\r\n                <li>Figma 所顯示的畫面比我們給受測者測試的裝置的螢幕大，因此受測者需要另外滑動才可以找到某些按鍵，讓受測者到了某一頁就無法進行操作。</li>\r\n                <li>我們在系統的設計上也不盡完美，有些按鍵總是無法讓受測者一看就知道他的操作方式</li>\r\n              </ul>\r\n              第二部份的話經過改良後雖然有比較順利，但整體而言，可以看到受測者們都會覺得任務二難以完成。\r\n            </Grid>\r\n\r\n            <Grid item

原因可能是因為放大鏡大部份時間都因為Figma 所顯示的畫面比我們的手機螢幕大，所以被放在螢幕底部，所以一直沒被發現。\r\n              </div>\r\n            </Grid>\r\n          </Grid>\r\n        </Paper>\r\n      </Grid>\r\n\r\n      <Grid item
